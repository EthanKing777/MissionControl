## Project Overview 

The initial brief of the mission control software was to develop software capable of displaying information from the Avionics package, from the monte carlo simulation package and also implementing a go/no-go feature for parameter checking and arming the rocket. This was expanded upon to include weather information fetch, display and checking. 

Over the course of the project, a mission control software package was designed and developed that was capable of fetching and displaying the relevant weather information to determine if a lunch should proceed, allowing a user to input and edit simulation parameters, display relevent simulation data/ models, display New Zealand flight zones and displaying information recieved from the Avionics package. 

## User Manual 

### Software Prerequisite

To run and modify the software package:
- Java 14+ (JDK)
- Apache Maven
- Scene Builder (optional, for editing of *.fxml files)

### Supported Operating Systems
The software was developed for three primary platforms. In theory, any system capable of running Java 14 should be able to run this software, however, there are no guarantees that it will run as intended.
- Windows 10
- Linux (KDE)
- macOS
