## Project Overview 

The initial brief of the mission control software was to develop software capable of displaying information from the Avionics package, from the monte carlo simulation package and also implementing a go/no-go feature for parameter checking and arming the rocket. This was expanded upon to include weather information fetch, display and checking. 

Over the course of the project, a mission control software package was designed and developed that was capable of fetching and displaying the relevant weather information to determine if a lunch should proceed, allowing a user to input and edit simulation parameters, display relevent simulation data/ models, display New Zealand flight zones and displaying information recieved from the Avionics package.
