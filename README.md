# Technical requirements

Although we aimed to make our project compatible with a wide variety of systems, there are still technical requirements to be able to run the software. Outlined below are some of the technical requirements for running this software package.


## Software prerequisites

To run and modify the software package:

- Java 14+ (JDK)
- Apache Maven
- Scene Builder (*optional*, for editing of *.fxml files)

## Operating systems

The software was developed for three primary platforms. In theory, any system capable of running Java 14 should be able to run this software, however, there are no guarantees that it will run as intended.

- Windows 10
- Linux (KDE)
- macOS
